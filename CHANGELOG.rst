**Protocol**

- In the hello view:

   - Add a ``bucket`` attribute in ``user`` mapping allowing clients
     to obtain the actual id of their default bucket
   - Add the ``protocol_version`` to tell which protocol version is
     implemented by the service. (#324)

- ``_since`` and ``_before`` now accepts an integer value between quotes ``"``,
  as it would be returned in the ``ETag`` response header.

  ``*_max_overflow``, ``*_pool_recycle``, ``*_pool_timeout`` to

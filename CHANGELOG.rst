-------------------

**Breaking changes**

- Remove Python 3.5 support and upgrade to Python 3.6. (#1886)
- Remove ``record`` from UnicityError class (#1919). This enabled us to fix #1545.
- Storage backend API has changed, notions of collection and records were replaced
  by the generic terms *resource* and *object*. Plugins that subclass the internal
  ``ShareableResource`` class may also break.
- GET requests no longer include the ``Total-Records`` header. To get a count in a collection
  you need to do a HEAD request. And the new header name is ``Total-Objects``. (#1624)
- Remove the ``UserResource`` class. And ``ShareableResource`` is now deprecated in
  favor of ``Resource``.
- Removed ``kinto.core.utils.parse_resource()`. Use ``kinto.core.utils.view_lookup_registry()`` instead (#1828)
- Remove delete-collection command (#1959)

API is now at version **1.21**. See `API changelog`_.

**New features**

- Add a ``user-data`` endpoint at ``/__user_data__/`` which can be used to delete all data
  associated with a principal. This might be helpful for pursuing GDPR
  compliance, for instance. (Fixes #442.)

**Bug Fixes**

- Like query now returns 400 when a non string value is used. (#1899)
- Record ID is validated if explicitly mentioned in the collection schema (#1942)
- The Memory permission backend implementation of ``remove_principal``
  is now less generous with what it removes (#1955).

**Internal changes**

- Remove depreciation warning for ``mapping`` (#1904)
- Fix depreciated warn method (#1903)
- Use f-string instead of % or format operators. (#1886)

**Internal changes**

- Build the admin on the CI. (#1857)
- Migrate JSON Hyper-Schema to Draft-07 (#1808)

- Blackify the whole code base (#1799, huge thanks to @Cnidarias for this!)
- Upgrade kinto-admin to v1.22


11.0.0 (2018-10-09)
-------------------

**Breaking changes**

- The ``basicauth`` policy is not used by default anymore (#1736)

If your application relies on this specific behaviour, you now have to add explicitly settings:

.. code-block:: ini

    multiauth.policies = basicauth

But **it is recommended** to use other authentication policies like the *OpenID Connect* or the *accounts* plugin instead.

.. code-block:: ini

    # Enable plugin.
    kinto.includes = kinto.plugins.accounts

    # Enable authenticated policy.
    multiauth.policies = account
    multiauth.policy.account.use = kinto.plugins.accounts.AccountsPolicy

    # Allow anyone to create their own account.
    kinto.account_create_principals = system.Everyone

You will find more details the `authentication settings section of the documentation <https://kinto.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration/settings.html#authentication>`_

**Bug fixes**

- Fix crash when querystring filter contains NUL (0x00) character (fixes #1704)
- Many bugs were fixed in the Kinto Admin UI (see `v1.21.0 <https://github.com/Kinto/kinto-admin/releases/tag/v1.21.0>`_)

**Documentation**

- Huge refactor of documentation about authentication (#1736)

**Internal changes**

- Deprecate assertEquals and use assertEqual (fixes #1780)
- Set schema to an instance instead of class (fixes #1781)

-------------------

**Bug fixes**

- Fix OpenID login in Kinto-Admin (Kinto/kinto-admin#641)

**Internal changes**

- Upgrade kinto-admin to v1.20.2


10.1.1 (2018-09-20)
-------------------

**Bug fixes**

- Fix for adding extra OpenId providers (fixes #1509)
- Change the meaning of ``event.payload["timestamp"]``. Previously it
  was ``@reify``\ 'd, which meant that it was calculated from before
  whatever thing triggered the event. Now we use a "fresh"
  timestamp. (Fixes #1469.)


10.1.0 (2018-09-17)
-------------------

**Bug fixes**

- Deleting a collection doesn't delete access_control_entrries for its children (fixes #1647)

**New features**

- The registry now has a "command" attribute during one-off commands
  such as ``kinto migrate``. This can be useful for plugins that want
  to behave differently during a migration, for instance. (#1762)


10.0.0 (2018-08-16)
-------------------

**Breaking changes**

- ``kinto.core.events.get_resource_events`` now returns a generator
  rather than a list.

**New features**

- Include Python 3.7 support.
- ``kinto.core.events.notify_resource_event`` now supports
  ``resource_name`` and ``resource_data``. These are useful when
  emitting events from one view "as though" they came from another
  view.
- Resource events can now trigger other resource events, which are
  handled correctly. This might be handy if one resource wants to
  simulate events on another "virtual" resource, as in ``kinto-changes``.

**Bug fixes**

- Raise a configuration error if the ``kinto.plugin.accounts`` is included without being enabled in policies.
  Without this *kinto-admin* would present a confusing login experience (fixes #1734).

**Internal changes**

- Upgrade kinto-admin to v1.20.0

9.2.0 (2018-06-07)
------------------

**API**

- JSON schemas can now be defined in the bucket metadata and will apply to every
  underlying collection, group or record (fixes #1555)

API is now at version **1.20**. See `API changelog`_.

**New features**

- Limit network requests to current domain in Kinto Admin using `Content-Security Policies <https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/02/implementing-content-security-policy/>`_
- Prompt for cache backend type in ``kinto init`` (#1653)
- kinto.core.utils now has new features ``route_path_registry`` and
  ``instance_uri_registry``, suitable for use when you don't
  necessarily have a ``request`` object around. The existing functions
  will remain in place.
- openid plugin will carry ``prompt=none`` querystring parameter if appended
  to authorize endpoint.

**Internal changes**

- Upgrade to kinto-admin v1.18.0


9.1.2 (2018-05-31)
------------------

**Bug fixes**

- OpenID plugin used the same cache key for every access-token (fixes #1660)

**Bug fixes**

- Fix a bug where you could not reach the last records via Next-Header when deleting with pagination (fixes #1170)
- Slight optimizations on the ``get_all`` query in the Postgres
  storage backend which should make it faster for result sets that
  have a lot of records (#1622). This is the first change meant to
  address #1507, though more can still be done.
- Fix a bug where the batch route accepted all content-types (fixes #1529)

**Internal changes**

- Upgrage to kinto-admin v1.17.1


9.0.0 (2018-04-25)
------------------

**API**

- Introduce ``contains`` and ``contains_any`` filter operators (fixes #343).

API is now at version **1.19**. See `API changelog`_.

**Breaking changes**

- The storage class now exposes ``bump_timestamp()`` and ``bump_and_store_timestamp()`` methods
  so that memory based storage backends can use them. (#1596)

**Internal changes**

- Authentication policies can now hard code and override the name specified in settings

**Documentation**

- Version number is taken from package in order to ease release process (#1594)
- Copyright year is now dynamic (#1595)

**Internal changes**

- Upgrade the kinto-admin UI to `1.17.0 <https://github.com/Kinto/kinto-admin/releases/tag/v1.17.0>`_


8.3.0 (2018-04-06)
------------------

**Security fix**

- Validate the account user password even when the session is cached (fixes #1583).
  Since Kinto 8.2.0 the account plugin had a security flaw where the password wasn't verified during the session duration.

**New features**

- Add bucket and account creation permissions in the permissions endpoint (fixes #1510)

**Bug fixes**

- Reduce the OpenID state string length to fit in the PostgreSQL cache backend (fixes #1566)

**Documentation**

- Improve OpenID settings and API documentation

**Internal Changes**

- Now fully rely on Pyup.io (or contributors) to update the versions in the `requirements.txt` file (fixes #1512)
- Move from importing pip to running it in a subprocess (see https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/5081).
- Remove useless print when using the OpenID policy (ref #1509)
- Try to recover from the race condition where two requests can delete the same record. (Fix #1557; refs #1407.)
- Fix a bug in the memory backend where paginating past the end of a list would restart pagination. (Refs #1584.)


8.2.2 (2018-03-28)
------------------

**Internal changes**

- Fix kinto-admin dependency error in 8.2.1 to actually really upgrade it to `1.15.1 <https://github.com/Kinto/kinto-admin/releases/tag/v1.15.1>`_


8.2.1 (2018-03-28)
------------------

**Internal changes**

- Upgraded the kinto-admin to version `1.15.1 <https://github.com/Kinto/kinto-admin/releases/tag/v1.15.1>`_
- Upgraded newrelic to `2.106.1.88 <https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/python-release-notes/python-agent-2106188>`_


8.2.0 (2018-03-01)
------------------

**New features**

- Add Openid connect support (#939, #1425). See `demo <https://github.com/leplatrem/kinto-oidc-demo>`_
- Account plugin now caches authentication verification (#1413)

**Bug fixes**

- Fix missing principals from user info in root URL when default bucket plugin is enabled (fixes #1495)
- Fix crash in Postgresql when the value of url param is empty (fixes #1305)

**Internal Changes**

- Upgraded the kinto-admin to version `1.15.0 <https://github.com/Kinto/kinto-admin/releases/tag/v1.15.0>`_


8.1.5 (2018-02-09)
------------------

**Bug fixes**

- Restore "look before you leap" behavior in the Postgres storage
  backend create() method to check whether a record exists before
  running the INSERT query (#1487). This check is "optimistic" in the sense
  that we can still fail to INSERT after the check succeeded, but it
  can reduce write load in configurations where there are a lot of
  create()s (i.e. when using the default_bucket plugin).


8.1.4 (2018-01-31)
------------------

**Bug fixes**

- Allow inherited resources to set a custom model instance before instantiating (fixes #1472)
- Fix collection timestamp retrieval when the stack is configured as readonly (fixes #1474)


8.1.3 (2018-01-26)
------------------

**Bug fixes**

- Optimize the PostgreSQL permission backend's
  ``delete_object_permissions`` function in the case where we are only
  matching one object_id (or object_id prefix).


8.1.2 (2018-01-24)
------------------

**Bug fixes**

- Flushing a server no longer breaks migration of the storage backend
  (#1460). If you have ever flushed a server in the past, migration
  may be broken. This version of Kinto tries to guess what version of
  the schema you're running, but may guess wrong. See
  https://github.com/Kinto/kinto/wiki/Schema-versions for some
  additional information.

**Internal changes**

- We now allow migration of the permission backend's schema.

**Operational concerns**

- *The schema for the Postgres permission backend has changed.* This
  changes another ID column to use the "C" collation, which should
  speed up the `delete_object_permissions` query when deleting a
  bucket.


8.1.1 (2018-01-18)
------------------

**Operational concerns**

- *The schema for the Postgres storage backend has changed.* This
  changes some more ID columns to use the "C" collation, which fixes a
  bug where the ``bump_timestamps`` trigger was very slow.


8.1.0 (2018-01-09)
------------------

**Internal changes**

- Update the Docker compose configuration to use memcache for the cache backend (#1405)
- Refactor the way postgresql.storage.create_from_settings ignores settings (#1410)

**Operational concerns**

- *The schema for the Postgres storage backend has changed.* This
  changes some ID columns to use the "C" collation, which will make
  ``delete_all`` queries faster. (See
  e.g. https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/indexes-opclass.html,
  which says "If you do use the C locale, you do not need the
  xxx_pattern_ops operator classes, because an index with the default
  operator class is usable for pattern-matching queries in the C
  locale.") This may change the default sort order and grouping of
  record IDs.

**New features**

- New setting ``kinto.backoff_percentage`` to only set the backoff header a portion of the time.
- ``make tdd`` allows development in a TDD style by rerunning tests every time a file is changed.

**Bug fixes**

- Optimize the Postgres collection_timestamp method by one query. It
  now only makes two queries instead of three.
- Update other dependencies: newrelic to 2.98.0.81 (#1409), setuptools
  to 38.4.0 (#1411, #1429, #1438, #1440), pytest to 3.3.2 (#1412,
  #1437), raven to 6.4.0 (#1421), werkzeug to 0.14.1 (#1418, #1434),
  python-memcached to 1.59 (#1423), zest.releaser to 6.13.3 (#1427),
  bravado_core to 4.11.2 (#1426, #1441), statsd to 3.2.2 (#1422),
  jsonpatch to 1.21 (#1432), sqlalchemy to 1.2.0 (#1430), sphinx to
  1.6.6 (#1442).

8.0.0 (2017-11-29)
------------------

**Breaking changes**

- Storage backends no longer support the ``ignore_conflict``
  argument (#1401). Instead of using this argument, consider catching the
  ``UnicityError`` and handling it. ``ignore_conflict`` was only ever
  used in one place, in the ``default_bucket`` plugin, and was
  eventually backed out in favor of catching and handling a
  ``UnicityError``.

**Bug fixes**

- Fix a TOCTOU bug in the Postgres storage backend where a transaction
  doing a `create()` would fail because a row had been inserted after
  the transaction had checked for it (#1376).


7.6.2 (2017-11-28)
------------------

**Operational concerns**

- *The schema for the Postgres ``storage`` backend has changed.* This
  lets us prevent a race condition where deleting and creating a thing
  at the same time can leave it in an inconsistent state (#1386). You
  will have to run the ``kinto migrate`` command in order to migrate
  the schema.

**Bug fixes**

- Document how to create an account using the ``POST /accounts`` endpoint (#1385).

**Internal changes**

- Update dependency on pytest to move to 3.3.0 (#1403).
- Update other dependencies: setuptools to 38.2.1 (#1380, #1381,
  #1392, #1395), jsonpatch to 1.20 (#1393), zest.releaser to 6.13.2
  (#1397), paste-deploy to 0.4.2 (#1384), webob to 1.7.4 (#1383),
  simplejson to 3.13.2 (#1389, #1390).
- Undo workaround for broken kinto-http.js in the kinto-admin plugin
  (#1382).

------------------

**Bug fixes**

- Fix kinto-admin loading.


7.6.0 (2017-11-16)
------------------

**Protocol**

- When a record is pushed with an older timestamp, the collection
  timestamps is not bumped anymore. (#1361)

**New features**

- A new custom logging formatter is available in ``kinto.core``. It fixes the issues of
  `mozilla-cloud-services-logger <https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-cloud-services-logger>`_.
  Consider migrating your logging settings to :

::

    [formatter_json]
    class = kinto.core.JsonLogFormatter

**Bug fixes**

- Do not log empty context values (ref #1363)
- Fixed some attributes in logging of errors (ref #1363)
- Fixed logging of method/path of batch subrequests (ref #1363)
- Fix removing permissions with Json Merge (#1322).


**Internal changes**

- Moved PostgreSQL helper function to Python code (ref #1358)

7.3.2 (2017-08-14)
------------------

**Bug fixes**

- The PostgreSQL cache backend now orders deletes according to keys,
  which are a well-defined order that never changes. (Fixes #1308.)

**Internal changes**

- Now all configuration options appear as commented lines on the configuration
  template (#895)
- Added task on PR template about updating the configuration template
  if a new configuration setting is added.
- Use json instead of ujson in storage in tests (#1255)
- Improve Docker container to follow Dockerflow recommendations (fixes #998)


7.3.1 (2017-07-03)
------------------

**Bug fixes**

  filters and NULL values.


7.3.0 (2017-06-23)
------------------

**New features**

- Account plugin now allows account IDs to be email addresses (fixes
  #1283).

**Bug fixes**

- Make it illegal for a principal to be present in
  ``account_create_principals`` without also being in
  ``account_write_principals``. Restricting creation of accounts to
  specified users only makes sense if those users are "admins", which
  means they're in ``account_write_principals``. (Fixes #1281.)
- Fix a 500 when accounts without an ID are created (fixes #1280).
- Fix StatsD unparseable metric packets for the unique user counter (fixes #1282)

7.2.0 (2017-06-15)
------------------

**API**

- Filtering with like can now contain wild chars (eg. ``?like_nobody=*you*``).
  It is thus now impossible to search for the ``*`` character with this operator.
- Handle querystring parameters as JSON encoded values
  to avoid treating number as number where they should be strings. (#1217)
- Introduce ``has_`` filter operator (fixes #344).

API is now at version **1.17**. See `API changelog`_.

**Bug fixes**

- Several changes to the handling of NULLs and how the full range of
  JSON values is compared in a storage backend (PR #1258). Combined
  with #1252, this should fix #1215, #1216, #1217 and #1257, as well as
  possibly some others.
- Fix requests output when running with make serve (fixes #1242)
- Fix pagination on permissions endpoint (fixes #1157)
- Fix pagination when max fetch storage is reached (fixes #1266)
- Fix schema validation when internal fields like ``id`` or ``last_modified`` are
  marked as required (fixes #1244)
- Restore error format for JSON schema validation errors (which was
  changed in #1245).

**Internal changes**

- Add check on account plugin to avoid conflict with default ``basicauth`` policy (fixes #1177)

------------------

**New feature**

- ``delete()`` method from cache backend now returns the deleted value (fixes #1231)
- ``kinto rebuild-quotas`` script was written that can be run to
  repair the damage caused by #1226 (fixes #1230).

**Bug fixes**

- The ``default_bucket`` plugin no longer sends spurious "created"
  events for buckets and collections that already exist. This causes
  the ``quotas`` plugin to no longer leak "quota" when used with the
  ``default_bucket`` plugin. (#1226)
- Fix removal of timestamps when parent object is deleted (fixes #1233)
- Do not allow to reuse deletion tokens (fixes #1171)
- ``accounts`` plugin: fix exception on authentication. (#1224)

- Fix bug on bucket deletion where other buckets could be deleted too if their id
  started with the same id
- Fix permissions of accounts created with PUT by admin (ref #1248)
- Fix ownership of accounts created with POST by admin (fixes #1248)

  should be enabled using the ``includes`` section of the configuration file.
  ``KINTO_FLUSH_ENDPOINT_ENABLED`` environment variable is no longer supported. (#1147)
- Settings with ``cliquet.`` prefix are not supported anymore.
- Logging configuration now relies on standard Python logging module (#1150)

Before:

.. code-block:: ini

    kinto.logging_renderer = kinto.core.logs.ClassicLogRenderer

Now:

.. code-block:: ini

    [handler_console]
    ...
    formatter = color

    [formatters]
    keys = color

    [formatter_color]
    class = logging_color_formatter.ColorFormatter

- Forbid storing bytes in the cache backend. (#1143)
- ``kinto.core.api`` was renamed to ``kinto.core.openapi`` (#1145)

  (#1110, #1150)
- Cache entries must now always have a TTL. The ``ttl`` parameter of ``cache.set()``

------------------

**Protocol**

- Fix error response consistency with safe creations if the ``create`` permission
  is granted (fixes #792). The server now returns a ``412`` instead of a ``403`` if
  the ``If-None-Match: *`` header is provided and the ``create`` permission is granted.
- The ``permissions`` attribute is now empty in the response if the user has not the permission
  to write on the object (fixes #123)
- Filtering records now works the same on the memory and postgresql backends:
  if we're comparing to a number, the filter will now filter out records that
  don't have this field. If we're comparing to anything else, the record
  without such a field is treated as if it had '' as the value for this field.
  (fixes #815)
- Parent **attributes are now readable** if children creation is allowed. That means for example
  that collection attributes are now readable to users with ``record:create`` permission.
  Same applies to bucket attributes and ``collection:create`` and ``group:create`` (fixes #803)

- Allow sub-object filtering on plural endpoints (e.g ``?person.name=Eliot``) (#345)
- Allow sub-object sorting on plural endpoints (e.g ``?_sort=person.name``) (#345)

Protocol is now at version **1.9**. See `API changelog`_.

**New features**

- Added a new built-in plugin ``kinto.plugins.history`` that keeps track of every action
  that occured within a bucket and serves a stream of changes that can be synced.
  See `API documentation <https://kinto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/1.x/history.html>`_.
- Added a new ``--dry-run`` option to command-line script ``migrate`` that will simulate
  migration operation without executing on the backend (thanks @lavish205! #685)
- Added ability to plug custom StatsD backend implementations via a new ``kinto.statsd_backend``
  setting. Useful for Datadogâ˘ integration for example (fixes #626).
- Added a ``delete-collection`` action to the ``kinto`` command. (#727)
- Added verbosity options to the ``kinto`` command. (#745)

- Remove former Cliquet load tests (#733)
- Add a flag to to run simulation load tests on ``default`` bucket. Uses ``blog``
  bucket by default (#733)
- Add command-line documentation (#727)
- The ``--backend`` command-line option for ``kinto init`` is not accepted as first
  parameter anymore
- Improved parts of the FAQ (#744)
- Improve 404 and 403 error handling to make them customizable. (#748)
- ``kinto.core`` resources are now schemaless by default (fixes #719)


3.3.3 (2016-09-12)
------------------

3.3.2 (2016-07-21)
------------------

**Bug fixes**

- Fix bug where the resource events of a request targetting two groups/collection
  from different buckets would be grouped together.


3.3.1 (2016-07-19)
------------------

**Protocol**

- Add the ``permissions_endpoint`` capability when the ``kinto.experimental_permissions_endpoint`` is set. (#722)


3.3.0 (2016-07-18)
------------------

**Protocol**

- Add new *experimental* endpoint ``GET /v1/permissions`` to retrieve the list of permissions
  granted on every kind of object (#600).
  Requires setting ``kinto.experimental_permissions_endpoint`` to be set to ``true``.

Protocol is now at version **1.8**. See `API changelog`_.

**Bug fixes**

- Fix crash in authorization policy when requesting ``GET /buckets/collections`` (fixes #695)
- Fix crash with PostgreSQL storage backend when provided id in POST is an integer (#688).
  Regression introduced in 3.2.0 with #655.

  the records endpoint of an unknown collection (fixes #693, related #558)
- Fix events payloads for actions in the default bucket (fixes #704)
- Fix bug in object permissions with memory backend
- Make sure the tombstone is deleted when the record is created with PUT. (#715)
- Allow filtering and sorting by any attribute on buckets, collections and groups list endpoints
- Fix crash in memory backend with Python3 when filtering on unknown field

**Internal changes**

  built immediately when event is fired instead of during transactoin commit (#704).
- Fix crash when a resource is registered without record path.
- Changed behaviour of accessible objects in permissions backend when list of
  bound permissions is empty.

- Changed ``get_accessible_objects()``, ``get_authorized_principals()`` methods
  in ``permission`` backend (#714)
- Simplified and improved the code quality of ``kinto.core.authorization``,
  mainly by keeping usage of ``get_bound_permissions`` callback in one place only.


3.2.0 (2016-06-14)
------------------

**Protocol**

- Allow record IDs to be any string instead of just UUIDs (fixes #655).

Protocol is now at version **1.7**. See `API changelog`_.

**New features**

- ``kinto start`` now accepts a ``--port`` option to specify which port to listen to.
  **Important**: Because of a limitation in `Pyramid tooling <http://stackoverflow.com/a/21228232/147077>`_,
  it won't work if the port is hard-coded in your existing ``.ini`` file. Replace
  it by ``%(http_port)s`` or regenerate a new configuration file with ``kinto init``.
- Add support for ``pool_timeout`` option in Redis backend (fixes #620)
- Add new setting ``kinto.heartbeat_timeout_seconds`` to control the maximum duration
  of the heartbeat endpoint (fixes #601)
- Ability to define ID generators per object type via the settings

**Bug fixes**

- Fix loss of data attributes when permissions are replaced with ``PUT`` (fixes #601)
- Fix 400 response when posting data with ``id: "default"`` in default bucket.
- Fix 500 on heartbeat endpoint when a check does not follow the specs and raises instead of
  returning false.

**Internal changes**

- Renamed some permission backend methods for consistency with other classes (fixes #608)
- Removed some deprecated code that had been in ``kinto.core`` for too long.

**Documentation**

- Mention in groups documentation that the principal of a group to be used in a permissions
  definition is the full URI (e.g. ``"write": ["/buckets/blog/groups/authors"]``)

------------------

**Protocol**

- Added the ``GET /contribute.json`` endpoint for open-source information (fixes #607)

Protocol is now at version **1.6**. See `API changelog`_.


**Bug fixes**

- Fix internal storage filtering when an empty list of values is provided.
- Authenticated users are now allowed to obtain an empty list of buckets on
  ``GET /buckets`` even if no bucket is readable (#454)
- Fix enabling flush enpoint with ``KINTO_FLUSH_ENDPOINT_ENABLED`` environment variable (fixes #588)

3.0.1 (2016-05-20)
------------------

**Bug fixes**

- Fix crash when a cache expires setting is set for a specific bucket or collection. (#597)
- Mark old cliquet backend settings as deprecated (but continue to support them). (#596)


3.0.0 (2016-05-18)
------------------

- Major version update. Merged cliquet into kinto.core. This is
  intended to simplify the experience of people who are new to Kinto.
  Addresses #687.
- Removed ``initialize_cliquet()``, which has been deprecated for a while.
- Removed ``cliquet_protocol_version``. Kinto already defines
  incompatible API variations as part of its URL format (e.g. ``/v0``,
  ``/v1``). Services based on kinto.core are free to use
  ``http_api_version`` to indicate any additional changes to their
  APIs.
- Simplify settings code. Previously, ``public_settings`` could be
  prefixed with a project name, which would be reflected in the output
  of the ``hello`` view. However, this was never part of the API
  specification, and was meant to be solely a backwards-compatibility
  hack for first-generation Kinto clients. Kinto public settings
  should always be exposed unprefixed. Applications developed against
  kinto.core can continue using these names even after they transition
  clients to the new implementation of their service.

**Bug fixes**

- Add an explicit message when the server is configured as read-only and the
  collection timestamp fails to be saved (ref Kinto/kinto#558)
- Prevent the browser to cache server responses between two sessions. (#593)
- Redirects version prefix to hello page when trailing_slash_redirect is enabled. (#700)
- Fix crash when setting empty permission list with PostgreSQL permission backend (fixes Kinto/kinto#575)
- Fix crash when type of values in querystring for exclude/include is wrong (fixes Kinto/kinto#587)
- Fix crash when providing duplicated principals in permissions with PostgreSQL permission backend (fixes #702)
- Add ``app.wsgi`` to the manifest file. This helps address #543.


2.1.1 (2016-04-29)
------------------

**Bug fixes**

- Fix crash in JSON schema validation when additional properties are provided (fixes #548)
- Strip internal fields before validating JSON schema (fixes #549)
- Fix migration of triggers in PostgreSQL storage backend when upgrading from Kinto<2.0.
  Run the ``migrate`` command will basically re-create them (fixes #559)

**Documentation**

- Fix typo in RHEL installation instructions (#552, thanks @enkidulan!)
- Link to english version of kinto presentation article (#553, thanks @glasserc!)
- Document basics about PostgreSQL privileges (#547)
- Change links from readthedocs.org to readthedocs.io (#557)

Protocol is now in version **1.5**. See `API changelog`_.


2.0.0 (2016-03-08)
------------------

**Protocol**

- Allow buckets to store arbitrary properties. (#239, #462)
- Delete every (writable) buckets using ``DELETE /v1/buckets``
- Delete every (writable) collections using ``DELETE /v1/buckets/<bucket-id>/collections``

  For example, ``/records?_fields=address.street``.
- List responses are now sorted by last_modified descending by default (#434,
  thanks @ayusharma)

- Add the ``__lbheartbeat__`` endpoint, for load balancer membership test.
- Add the ``flush_endpoint``, ``schema`` and ``default_bucket`` to the capabilities
  if enabled in settings (#270)

Protocol is now in version **1.4**. See `API changelog`_.

**Breaking changes**

- ``kinto.plugins.default_bucket`` plugin is no longer assumed. We invite users
  to check that the ``kinto.plugins.default_bucket`` is present in the
  ``includes`` setting if they expect it. (ref #495)
- ``kinto start`` must be explicitly run with ``--reload`` in order to
  restart the server when code or configuration changes (ref #490).
- Errors are not swallowed anymore during the execution of ``ResourceChanged``
  events subscribers.

  Subscribers are still executed within the transaction like before.

  Subscribers are still executed even if the transaction is eventually rolledback.
  Every subscriber execution succeeds, or none.

  Thus, subscribers of these events should only perform operations that are reversed
  on transaction rollback: most likely database storage operations.

  For irreversible operations see the new ``AfterResourceChanged`` event.

**New features**

- Event subscribers are now ran synchronously and can thus alter responses (#421)
- Resource events are now merged in batch requests. One event per resource and
  per action is emitted when a transaction is committed (mozilla-services/cliquet#634)
- Monitor time of events listeners execution (mozilla-services/cliquet#503)
- Added a new ``AfterResourceChanged`` event, that is sent only when the commit
  in database is done and successful.
  `See more details <https://cliquet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/notifications.html>`_.
- Track execution time on StatsD for each authentication sub-policy (mozilla-services/cliquet#639)
- Default console log renderer now has colours (mozilla-service/cliquet#671)
- Output Kinto version with ``kinto --version`` (thanks @ayusharma)

**Bug fixes**

- Fix PostgreSQL backend timestamps when collection is empty (#433)
- ``ResourceChanged`` events are not emitted if a batch subrequest fails (mozilla-services/cliquet#634)
  There are still emitted if the whole batch transaction is eventually rolledback.
- Fix a migration of PostgreSQL schema introduced that was never executed (mozilla-services/cliquet#604)
- Fix statsd initialization on storage (mozilla-services/cliquet#637)
- Providing bad last modified values on delete now returns 400 (mozilla-services/cliquet#665)
- Providing last modified in the past for delete now follows behaviour create/update (mozilla-services/cliquet#665)
- Do not always return 412 errors when request header ``If-None-Match: *``
  is sent on ``POST /collection`` (fixes #489, mozilla-service/cliquet#673)
- Fix secret in ini on Python 3 (fixes #341)
- Error when trying to create an empty directory (fixes #475)

1.9.0 (2015-11-18)
------------------

- Upgraded to *Cliquet* 2.11.0

- For PostgreSQL backends, it is recommended to specify ``postgresql://``.

**Protocol**

- In the hello view:

   - Add a ``bucket`` attribute in ``user`` mapping allowing clients
     to obtain the actual id of their default bucket
   - Add the ``protocol_version`` to tell which protocol version is
     implemented by the service. (#324)

- ``_since`` and ``_before`` now accepts an integer value between quotes ``"``,
  as it would be returned in the ``ETag`` response header.
- A batch request now fails if one of the subrequests fails

- New settings for backends when using PostgreSQL: ``*_max_backlog``,
  ``*_max_overflow``, ``*_pool_recycle``, ``*_pool_timeout`` to
  control connections pool behaviour.

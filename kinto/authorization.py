# Vocab really matters when you deal with permissions. Let's do a quick recap
# of the terms used here:
#
# Object URI:
#    An unique identifier for an object.
#    for instance, /buckets/blog/collections/articles/records/article1
#
# Object:
#    A common denomination of an object (e.g. "collection" or "record")
#
# Unbound permission:
#    A permission not bound to an object (e.g. "create")
#
# Bound permission:
#    A permission bound to an object (e.g. "collection:create")


# Dictionary that associates single permissions to any other permission that
# automatically provides it
# Ex: bucket:read is granted by both bucket:write and bucket:read
PERMISSIONS_INHERITANCE_TREE = {
    "root": {"bucket:create": {}, "write": {}, "read": {}},  # Granted via settings only.
    "bucket": {
        "write": {"bucket": ["write"]},
        "read": {"bucket": ["write", "read"]},
        "read:attributes": {"bucket": ["write", "read", "collection:create", "group:create"]},
        "group:create": {"bucket": ["write", "group:create"]},
        "collection:create": {"bucket": ["write", "collection:create"]},
    },
    "group": {
        "write": {"bucket": ["write"], "group": ["write"]},
        "read": {"bucket": ["write", "read"], "group": ["write", "read"]},
    },
    "collection": {
        "write": {"bucket": ["write"], "collection": ["write"]},

class Storage(StorageBase, MigratorMixin):
    """Storage backend using PostgreSQL.

    Recommended in production (*requires PostgreSQL 9.4 or higher*).

    Enable in configuration::

        kinto.storage_backend = kinto.core.storage.postgresql

    Database location URI can be customized::

        kinto.storage_url = postgresql://user:pass@db.server.lan:5432/dbname

    Alternatively, username and password could also rely on system user ident
    or even specified in :file:`~/.pgpass` (*see PostgreSQL documentation*).

    .. note::

        Some tables and indices are created when ``kinto migrate`` is run.
        This requires some privileges on the database, or some error will
        be raised.

        **Alternatively**, the schema can be initialized outside the
        python application, using the SQL file located in
        :file:`kinto/core/storage/postgresql/schema.sql`. This allows to
        distinguish schema manipulation privileges from schema usage.


    A connection pool is enabled by default::

        kinto.storage_pool_size = 10
        kinto.storage_maxoverflow = 10
        kinto.storage_max_backlog = -1
        kinto.storage_pool_recycle = -1
        kinto.storage_pool_timeout = 30
        kinto.cache_poolclass =
            kinto.core.storage.postgresql.pool.QueuePoolWithMaxBacklog

    The ``max_backlog``  limits the number of threads that can be in the queue
    waiting for a connection.  Once this limit has been reached, any further
    attempts to acquire a connection will be rejected immediately, instead of
    locking up all threads by keeping them waiting in the queue.

    See `dedicated section in SQLAlchemy documentation
    <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_1_0/core/engines.html>`_
    for default values and behaviour.

    .. note::

        Using a `dedicated connection pool <http://pgpool.net>`_ is still
        recommended to allow load balancing, replication or limit the number
        of connections used in a multi-process deployment.

UNKNOWN_SCHEMA_VERSION_MESSAGE = """
Missing schema history. Perhaps at some point, this Kinto server was
flushed.  Due to a bug in older Kinto versions (see
https://github.com/Kinto/kinto/issues/1460), flushing the server would
cause us to forget what version of the schema was in use. This means
automatic migration is impossible.

Historically, when this happened, Kinto would just assume that the
wiped server had the "current" schema, so you may have been missing a
schema version for quite some time.

To try to recover, we have assumed a schema version corresponding to
the last Kinto version with this bug (schema version 20). However, if
a migration fails, or most queries are broken, you may not actually be
running that schema. You can try to fix this by manually setting the
schema version in the database to what you think it should be using a
command like:

    INSERT INTO metadata VALUES ('storage_schema_version', '19');

See https://github.com/Kinto/kinto/wiki/Schema-versions for more details.

class Permission(PermissionBase):
    """Permission backend using PostgreSQL.

    Enable in configuration::

        kinto.permission_backend = kinto.core.permission.postgresql

    Database location URI can be customized::

        kinto.permission_url = postgres://user:pass@db.server.lan:5432/dbname

    Alternatively, username and password could also rely on system user ident
    or even specified in :file:`~/.pgpass` (*see PostgreSQL documentation*).

    .. note::

        Some tables and indices are created when ``kinto migrate`` is run.
        This requires some privileges on the database, or some error will
        be raised.

        **Alternatively**, the schema can be initialized outside the
        python application, using the SQL file located in
        :file:`kinto/core/permission/postgresql/schema.sql`. This allows to
        distinguish schema manipulation privileges from schema usage.


    A connection pool is enabled by default::

        kinto.permission_pool_size = 10
        kinto.permission_maxoverflow = 10
        kinto.permission_max_backlog = -1
        kinto.permission_pool_recycle = -1
        kinto.permission_pool_timeout = 30
        kinto.cache_poolclass =
            kinto.core.storage.postgresql.pool.QueuePoolWithMaxBacklog

    The ``max_backlog``  limits the number of threads that can be in the queue
    waiting for a connection.  Once this limit has been reached, any further
    attempts to acquire a connection will be rejected immediately, instead of
    locking up all threads by keeping them waiting in the queue.

    See `dedicated section in SQLAlchemy documentation
    <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_1_0/core/engines.html>`_
    for default values and behaviour.

    .. note::

        Using a `dedicated connection pool <http://pgpool.net>`_ is still
        recommended to allow load balancing, replication or limit the number
        of connections used in a multi-process deployment.

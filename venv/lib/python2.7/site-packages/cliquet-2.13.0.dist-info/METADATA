Changelog
=========

This document describes changes between each past release.


2.13.0 (2015-12-01)
-------------------

**Bug fixes**

- Fixes duplicated records in paginated results when limit is forced via
  settings (fixes #588)

**New features**

- Allow to keep the ``last_modified`` field of records when updating or
  creating them. Useful for replication of remote collections (fixes #604)

**Internal changes**

- Documentation has been updated to explain better how versionning is
  handled (fixes #603)



2.12.0 (2015-11-27)
-------------------

**Protocol**

Minor changes in the root URL (hello view):

- Added ``http_api_version`` (#600)
- Renamed ``hello`` to ``project_name``
- Renamed ``protocol_version`` to ``cliquet_protocol_version``
- Renamed ``documentation`` to ``project_docs``
- Renamed ``version`` to ``project_version``

**Breaking changes**

- When using *cliquet-fxa*, the setting ``multiauth.policy.fxa.use`` must now
  be explicitly set to ``cliquet_fxa.authentication.FxAOAuthAuthenticationPolicy``
- Fields in the root view were renamed (#600)

**Bug fixes**

- Include plugins after setting up components (like authn/authz) so that plugins
  can register views with permissions checking
- Remove ``__permissions__`` from impacted records values in ``ResourceChanged``
  events (#586)

**New features**

- New options in configuration of listeners to specify filtered actions and
  resource names (#492, #555)
- Add ability to listen to read action on resource (disabled by default)
  (#493)

**Internal**

- Fixed a few details in quickstart docs since backends are not Redis by default
  anymore
- Replace usage of ``assert`` by explicit exceptions since the former can
  be ignored when python is ran with ``-O`` (fixes #592)
- Improved documentation about permissions (#572, thanks for the feedback @MrChoclate)
- Fixed docs building under Python 3 (#591)


2.11.0 (2015-11-17)
-------------------

**Protocol**

- ``_since`` and ``_before`` now accepts an integer value between quotes ``"``,
  as it would be returned in the ``ETag`` response header.
- A batch request now fails if one of the subrequests fails (#510)
  (*see new feature about transactions*)

**Breaking changes**

- For PostgreSQL backends, it is recommended to specify ``postgresql://``.

**New features**

- A transaction now covers the whole request/response cycle (#510, Kinto/kinto#194).
  If an error occurs during the request processing, every operation performed
  is rolled back. **Note:** This is only enabled with *PostgreSQL* backends. In
  other words, the rollback has no effect on backends like *Redis* or *Memory*.

- Add the ``protocol_version`` to tell which protocol version is
  implemented by the service in the hello page. (#324)

- New settings for backends when using PostgreSQL: ``*_pool_maxoverflow``,
  ``*_pool_recycle``, ``*_pool_timeout`` to control connections pool
  behaviour.
- Add custom pool supporting a ``max_backlog`` parameter that limits the
  number of threads waiting for a connection (#509)
- Add ``impacted_records`` attribute on ``ResourceChanged`` event (#501)
  This also allows listeners to react on particular field change, since old and
  new version of records is provided.

**Bug fixes**

- Fix Service CORS not being set when plugins are included
- Fix crash with Redis backend if record parent/id is unicode (fixes #556)
- Fix principals of permission backend not being plugged by default (#573)
- Fix Redis error traces not being logged (#560)
- Fix principals of permission backend not being plugged by default. (#573)
- Maintain pagination offset to prevent pagination loop in some cases. (#366)

**Internal changes**

- Switch to SQLAlchemy for smarter connections pools.
- Added a simple end-to-end test on a *Cliquet* sample application, using
  `Loads <http://github.com/loads/>`_. (fixes #512)
- Switched to SQLAlchemy sessions instead of raw connections and cursors. (#510)
- Refactor Redis clients instantiation to avoid repeated defaults. (#567, #568)
- Initialize Service class attributes before including plugins. (#578)
- Add a statsd_count helper function to ease the usage of statsd. (#574)
- Mention SQLAlchemy on missing PostgreSQL dependencies. (#545)

  view.

- Set cache headers only when anonymous (fixes #449)
- Follow redirections in batch subrequests (fixes #511)
- When recreating a record that was previously deleted, status code is now ``201``
  (ref #530).

**New features**

- Follow redirections in batch subrequests (fixes #511)
- Add a ``readonly`` setting to run the service in read-only mode. (#525)
- If no client cache is set, add ``Cache-Control: no-cache`` by default,
  so that clients are forced to revalidate their cache against the server
  (#522, ref Kinto/kinto#231)

**Bug fixes**

- Fix PostgreSQL error when deleting an empty collection in a protected
  resource (fixes #528)
- Fix PUT not using ``create()`` method in storage backend when tombstone exists
  (fixes #530)
- Delete tombstone when record is re-created (fixes #518)

**Protocol**

**Breaking changes**

- Renamed internal backend classes for better consistency. Settings
  remain unchanged, but if you imported the backend classes in your
  Cliquet application, it will break (#491).

  module. (#505)

  (either with ``cliquet.initialize()`` or with the ``cliquet.project_name``

Rationale
#########

*Cliquet* is a toolkit to ease the implementation of HTTP `microservices`_.
It is mainly focused on data-driven REST APIs (aka :term:`CRUD`).

.. _microservices: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices


Philosophy
==========

* :term:`KISS`;
* No magic;
* Works with defaults;
* Easy customization;
* Straightforward component substitution.

*Cliquet* doesn't try to be a framework: any project built with *Cliquet* will
expose a well defined HTTP protocol for:

* Collection and records manipulation;
* HTTP status and headers handling;
* API versioning and deprecation;
* Errors formatting.

:ref:`This protocol <api-endpoints>` is an implementation of a series of good
practices (followed at `Mozilla Services`_ and `elsewhere`_).

.. _Mozilla Services: https://wiki.mozilla.org/CloudServices
.. _elsewhere: http://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api

The goal is to produce standardized APIs, which follow some
well known patterns, encouraging genericity in clients code [#]_.

Of course, *Cliquet* can be :term:`extended <extensible>` and customized in
many ways. It can also be used in any kind of project, for its tooling, utilities
and helpers.


Features
========

It is built around the notion of resources: resources are defined by sub-classing,
and *Cliquet* brings up the HTTP endpoints automatically.

Records and synchronization
---------------------------

* Collection of records by user;
* Optional validation from schema;
* Sorting and filtering;
* Pagination using continuation tokens;
* Polling for collection changes;
* Record race conditions handling using preconditions headers;
* Notifications channel (e.g. run asynchronous tasks on changes).


Generic endpoints
-----------------

* Hello view at root url;
* Heartbeat for monitoring;
* Batch operations;
* API versioning and deprecation;
* Errors formatting;
* ``Backoff`` and ``Retry-After`` headers.

Toolkit

    *Cliquet* brings a set of simple but essential features to build APIs.

* Configuration through INI files or environment variables;
* Pluggable storage and cache backends;
* Pluggable authentication and user groups management;
* Pluggable authorization and permissions management;
* Structured logging;
* Monitoring tools;
* Profiling tools.

:term:`Pluggable` components can be replaced by another one via configuration.


Dependencies
============

*Cliquet* is built on the shoulders of giants:

* :rtd:`Cornice <cornice>` for the REST helpers;
* :rtd:`Pyramid <pyramid>` for the heavy HTTP stuff;
* `SQLAlchemy <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org>`_ core, for database sessions and
  pooling;

Everything else is meant to be **pluggable and optional**.

    Examples of configuration for a *Cliquet* application in production.

* *Basic Auth*, *FxA OAuth2* or any other source of authentication;
* *Default* or custom class for authorization logics;
* *PostgreSQL* for storage;
* *Redis* for key-value cache with expiration;
* *StatsD* metrics;
* *Sentry* reporting via logging;
* *NewRelic* database profiling (*for development*);
* *Werkzeug* Python code profiling (*for development*).

A *Cliquet* application can change or force default values for any setting.


Built with Cliquet
==================

Some applications in the wild built with *Cliquet*:

* :rtd:`Reading List <readinglist>`, a service to synchronize articles between
  devices;
* :rtd:`Kinto <kinto>`, a service to store and synchronize schema-less data.
* :rtd:`Syncto <syncto>`, a service to access *Firefox Sync* using *kinto.js*.
* *Please contact us to add yours*.


Context
-------

(*to be done*)

* Cloud Services team at Mozilla
* :rtd:`ReadingList <readinglist>` project story
* Firefox Sync
* Cloud storage
* Firefox OS User Data synchronization and backup


Vision
======

General
-------

Any application built with *Cliquet*:

* follows the same conventions regarding the HTTP API;
* takes advantage of its component :term:`pluggability <pluggable>`;
* can be :term:`extended <extensible>` using custom code or Pyramid external
  packages;

Let's build a :ref:`sane ecosystem <ecosystem>` for microservices in Python!


Roadmap
-------

The future features we plan to implement in *Cliquet* are currently driven by the
use-cases we meet internally at Mozilla. Most notable are:

* Attachments on records (e.g. *Remote Storage* compatibility);
* Records generic indexing (e.g. streaming records to *ElasticSearch*).

* ... come and discuss `enhancements in the issue tracker`_!

.. _enhancements in the issue tracker: https://github.com/mozilla-services/cliquet/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement


Similar projects
================

* `Python Eve <http://python-eve.org/>`_, built on Flask and MongoDB;
* *Please contact us to add more if any*.

Since the protocol is language independant and follows good HTTP/REST principles,
in the long term *Cliquet* should become only one among several server implementations.

.. note::

    We encourage you to implement a clone of this project — using Node.js, Asyncio,
    Go, Twisted, Django or anything else — following :ref:`the same protocol <api-endpoints>`!

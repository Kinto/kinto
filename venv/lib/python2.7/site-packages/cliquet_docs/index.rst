    A cliquet, or ratchet, is a mechanical device that allows continuous linear
    or rotary motion in only one direction while preventing motion in the
    opposite direction.

    A cliquet provides some basic but essential functionality â€” efficient in a
    variety of contexts, from bikes rear wheels to most advanced clockmaking!

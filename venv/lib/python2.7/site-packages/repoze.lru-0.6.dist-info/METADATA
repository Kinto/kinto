repoze.lru
==========

``repoze.lru`` is a LRU (least recently used) cache implementation.  Keys and
values that are not used frequently will be evicted from the cache faster
than keys and values that are used frequently.  It works under Python 2.5,
Python 2.6, Python 2.7, and Python 3.2.

Please see ``docs/index.rst`` for detailed documentation.


Changelog
=========

- Added statistics to each cache, tracking lookups, hits, misses, and
  evictions.

- Automated building Sphinx docs and testing example snippets under ``tox``.

- Added Sphinx documentation.

- Dropped support for Python 2.5.

- Added support for PyPy.

- Added ``setup.py docs`` alias (installs ``Sphinx`` and dependencies).

- Added ``setup.py dev`` alias (runs ``develop`` plus installs ``nose``
  and ``coverage``).

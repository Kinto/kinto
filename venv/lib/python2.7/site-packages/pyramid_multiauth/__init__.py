    This function provides a hook for pyramid to include the default settings
    for auth via pyramid_multiauth.  Activate it like so:

        config.include("pyramid_multiauth")

    This will pull the list of registered authn policies from the deployment
    settings, and configure and install each policy in order.  The policies to
    use can be specified in one of two ways:

        * as the name of a module to be included.
        * as the name of a callable along with a set of parameters.

    Here's an example suite of settings:

        multiauth.policies = ipauth1 ipauth2 pyramid_browserid

        multiauth.policy.ipauth1.use = pyramid_ipauth.IPAuthentictionPolicy
        multiauth.policy.ipauth1.ipaddrs = 123.123.0.0/16
        multiauth.policy.ipauth1.userid = local1

        multiauth.policy.ipauth2.use = pyramid_ipauth.IPAuthentictionPolicy
        multiauth.policy.ipauth2.ipaddrs = 124.124.0.0/16
        multiauth.policy.ipauth2.userid = local2

    This will configure a MultiAuthenticationPolicy with three policy objects.
    The first two will be IPAuthenticationPolicy objects created by passing
    in the specified keyword arguments.  The third will be a BrowserID
    authentication policy just like you would get from executing:

        config.include("pyramid_browserid")

    As a side-effect, the configuration will also get the additional views
    that pyramid_browserid sets up by default.

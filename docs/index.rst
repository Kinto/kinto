    `Kinto-Un <http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Flying_Nimbus>`_ is a magical,
    yellow cloud that serves as a way of transportation.


In short
========

It's as simple as that:

1. Pick up a name for your records collection;
2. Push the records on the server;
3. Pull the records from the server (ordered, filtered, paginated)

The server doesn't impose anything about the records data model.

*Kinto* is based on top of `cliquet <http://cliquet.readthedocs.org>`_.

.. _collections:

Collections
###########

A collection belongs to a bucket and stores records.

A collection is a mapping with the following attribute:

* ``permissions``: (*optional*) the :term:`ACLs <ACL>` for the collection object

.. note::

    By default users are assigned to a bucket that is used for their
    personal data.

    Application can use this default bucket with the ``default``
    shortcut: ie ``/buckets/default/collections/contacts`` will be
    the current user contacts.

    Internally the user default bucket is assigned to an id that can
    later be used to share data from a user personnal bucket.

    Collection on a the default bucket are created silently on first access.

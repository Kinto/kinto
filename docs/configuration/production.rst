Running in production
#####################

*Kinto* is a standard Python application.

Recommended settings for production are listed below. Some :ref:`general insights about deployment strategies
<deployment>` are also provided.

Because we use it for most of our deploys, *PostgreSQL* is the recommended
backend for production.


.. _postgresql-install:

Install and setup PostgreSQL
============================

(*requires PostgreSQL 9.5 or higher*).

*Kinto* dependencies do not include *PostgreSQL* tooling and drivers by default, which should be installed and configured before proceeding to the next steps. More information is available at the `PostgreSQL Documentation <http://www.postgresql.org/docs>`_.


PostgreSQL client
-----------------

Before installing the Python libraries for PostgreSQL we need to first install the header files for the PostgreSQL database backend.

On Debian / Ubuntu based systems::

    $ sudo apt-get install libpq-dev

On RedHat / Fedora / Mint based systems::

    $ yum install postgresql-devel

On MacOS::

    $ brew install postgresql

See also `install a server or use port <http://superuser.com/questions/296873/install-libpq-dev-on-mac-os>`_.

Install PostgreSQL Python Dependencies
--------------------------------------

Kinto PostgreSQL backends rely on specific Python packages (like `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_ and `psycopg2 <http://initd.org/psycopg/>`_), which can be installed with a single *pip* command ::

    $ pip install -U kinto[postgresql]


Run a PostgreSQL server
-----------------------

The instructions to run a local PostgreSQL database are out of scope here.

A detailed guide is `available on the Kinto Wiki <https://github.com/Kinto/kinto/wiki/How-to-run-a-PostgreSQL-server%3F>`_.


Database setup
--------------

*Kinto* default database name is set to ``postgres`` on ``localhost:5432``. To change it refer to `Creating a configuration file`_.

To create a specific database:

.. code-block:: sql

    CREATE DATABASE dbname WITH ENCODING UTF8;

By default *Kinto* uses *UTC timezone*, so make sure that the assigned database for kinto is set to UTC with:

.. code-block:: sql

    ALTER DATABASE dbname SET TIMEZONE TO UTC;

Privileges basics
-----------------

*Kinto* default user is set to ``postgres`` with password ``postgres``. To change that refer to `Creating a configuration file`_.

In order to initialize the database tables and objects, the specified user must
have some privileges. For example, to create a user from scratch:

.. code-block:: sql

    CREATE USER dbuser WITH PASSWORD 'dbpassword';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE dbname TO dbuser;

For a read-only setup, it is possible to define a user that only has the privilege
to read the tables:

.. code-block:: sql

    CREATE USER dbuser WITH PASSWORD 'dbpassword';
    GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO dbuser;
    GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO dbuser;

In this case, you should use the ``kinto.readonly`` setting to tell
Kinto that the database is read-only.

Even if the stack is read-only, some internal values like authentication tokens
may still be to be stored in cache. If the cache backend is configured to use
PostgreSQL, then write operations still must be granted on the ``cache`` table:

.. code-block:: sql

    GRANT UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE ON cache TO dbuser;

Also, in future versions of Kinto, some new tables may be created. It is possible to
change the default privileges to allow reading the future tables:

.. code-block:: sql

    ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO dbuser;


Creating a configuration file
-----------------------------

Once a PostgreSQL is up and running somewhere, you should edit your configuration file or create a new one with the ``init`` command and select the PostgreSQL option. The file is created by default as ``config/kinto.ini``, to specify another filename use the ``--ini`` parameter.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ kinto init --ini production.ini


Select your database server address, name and user by editing the configuration file. Also make sure that the PostgreSQL :ref:`backend settings<configuration-backends>` are selected. For our example, the backend configuration would be:

.. code-block:: python

    kinto.storage_backend = kinto.core.storage.postgresql
    kinto.storage_url = postgresql://dbuser:dbpassword@localhost/dbname
    kinto.cache_backend = kinto.core.cache.postgresql
    kinto.cache_url = postgresql://dbuser:dbpassword@localhost/dbname
    kinto.permission_backend = kinto.core.permission.postgresql
    kinto.permission_url = postgresql://dbuser:dbpassword@localhost/dbname


Creating tables and indices
---------------------------

The last step consists in creating the necessary tables and indices, run the ``migrate`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ kinto migrate --ini production.ini

.. important::
    You should run ``migrate`` every time you change the configuration file or kinto is upgraded.


.. note::

    Alternatively the SQL initialization files can be found in the
    *Kinto* `source <https://github.com/Kinto/kinto>`_.


Production checklist
====================

Recommended settings
--------------------

Most default setting values in the application code base are suitable
for production.

Also, the set of settings mentionned below might deserve some review or
adjustments:

.. code-block :: ini

    kinto.http_scheme = https
    kinto.paginate_by = 100
    kinto.batch_max_requests = 25
    kinto.storage_pool_size = 50
    kinto.cache_pool_size = 50
    kinto.permission_pool_size = 50
    fxa-oauth.cache_ttl_seconds = 3600

.. note::

    For an exhaustive list of available settings and their default values,
    refer to the *Kinto* `source code <https://github.com/Kinto/kinto/blob/13.6.2/kinto/core/__init__.py#L34-L103>`_.


By default, nobody can read buckets list. You can change that using:

.. code-block :: ini

    kinto.bucket_read_principals = system.Authenticated

Beware that if you do so, everyone will be able to list bucket
information (including user's personal buckets).


Handling CDN
------------

If you want to put your Kinto behind a CDN you must make sure to define the
right host or you will leak the main server host.

.. code-block:: ini

    kinto.http_host = cdn.firefox.com

You can make sure your service is correctly configured by looking at the service URL
returned on the service home page. It should be your CDN service URL.

It might also be relevant to set your main server :ref:`as readonly <configuration-features>`.

In the configuration of the CDN service, you should also:

- Allow ``OPTIONS`` requests (CORS)
- Pass through cache and concurrency control headers: ``ETag``, ``Last-Modified``, ``Expire``
- Pass through pagination header: ``Next-Page``
- Cached responses should depend on querystring parameters (e.g. try with different ``?_limit=`` values)


Monitoring
----------

In order to enable monitoring features like *statsd*, install
extra requirements:

::

    make install-monitoring

And configure its URL:

.. code-block :: ini

    # StatsD
    kinto.statsd_url = udp://carbon.server:8125

Counters
::::::::

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Name", "Description"
   :widths: 10, 100

   "``users``", "Number of unique user IDs."
   "``authn_type.basicauth``", "Number of basic authentication requests"
   "``authn_type.fxa``", "Number of FxA authentications"

Timers
::::::

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Name", "Description"
   :widths: 10, 100

   "``authentication.permits``", "Time needed by the permissions backend to allow or reject a request"
   "``view.hello.GET``", "Time needed to return the hello view"
   "``view.heartbeat.GET``", "Time needed to return the heartbeat page"
   "``view.batch.POST``", "Time needed to process a batch request"
   "``view.{resource}-{type}.{method}``", "Time needed to process the specified *{method}* on a *{resource}* (e.g. bucket, collection or record). Different timers exists for the different type of resources (record or collection)"
   "``cache.{method}``", "Time needed to execute a method of the cache backend. Methods are ``ping``, ``ttl``, ``expire``, ``set``, ``get`` and ``delete``"
   "``storage.{method}``", "Time needed to execute a method of the storage backend. Methods are ``ping``, ``collection_timestamp``, ``create``, ``get``, ``update``, ``delete``, ``delete_all``, ``get_all``"
   "``permission.{method}``", "Time needed to execute a method of the permission backend. Methods are ``add_user_principal``, ``remove_user_principal``, ``get_user_principals``, ``add_principal_to_ace``, ``remove_principal_from_ace``, ``get_object_permission_principals``, ``check_permission``"


JSON Logging
------------

At Mozilla, applications' log files follow a specific JSON schema, that is
processed through `Kibana <https://github.com/elastic/kibana>`_ or
`Heka <https://hekad.readthedocs.io>`_.

With the following configuration, all logs are structured in JSON and
redirected to standard output (See `12factor app <http://12factor.net/logs>`_).

.. note::

    You must install the ``mozilla-cloud-services-logger`` package.

.. code-block:: ini

    [loggers]
    keys = root

    [handlers]
    keys = console

    [formatters]
    keys = generic, json

    [logger_root]
    level = INFO
    handlers = console

    [handler_console]
    class = StreamHandler
    args = (sys.stdout,)
    level = NOTSET
    formatter = json

    [formatter_json]
    class = kinto.core.JsonLogFormatter

    [formatter_generic]
    format = %(asctime)s,%(msecs)03d %(levelname)-5.5s [%(name)s] %(message)s
    datefmt = %H:%M:%S


Run the Kinto application
=========================

Using Apache mod wsgi
---------------------

This is probably the easiest way to setup a production server.

With the following configuration for the site, Apache should be able to
run the Kinto application:

::

    WSGIScriptAlias /         /path/to/kinto/app.wsgi
    WSGIPythonPath            /path/to/kinto
    SetEnv          KINTO_INI /path/to/kinto.ini

    <Directory /path/to/kinto>
      <Files app.wsgi>
        Require all granted
      </Files>
    </Directory>


Using nginx
-----------

nginx can act as a *reverse proxy* in front of `uWSGI <https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io>`_
(or any other wsgi server like `Gunicorn <http://gunicorn.org>`_ or `Circus <https://circus.readthedocs.io>`_).

Download the ``uwsgi_params`` file:

::

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nginx/nginx/master/conf/uwsgi_params


Configure nginx to listen to a uwsgi running:

::

    upstream kinto {
        server unix:///var/uwsgi/kinto.sock;
    }

    server {
        listen      8000;
        server_name .my-kinto.org; # substitute your machine's IP address or FQDN
        charset     utf-8;

        # max upload size
        client_max_body_size 75M;   # adjust to taste

        location / {
            uwsgi_pass  kinto;
            include     /path/to/uwsgi_params; # the uwsgi_params file previously downloaded
        }
    }


It is also wise to restrict the private URLs (like for ``__heartbeat__``):

::

    location ~ /v1/__(.+)__ {
        allow 127.0.0.1;
        allow 172.31.17.16;
        deny all;
    }


Running with uWSGI
------------------

::

    pip install uwsgi

To run the application using uWSGI, an **app.wsgi** file must be picked up.
It is available in the *Kinto* Python package or can be downloaded from GitHub::

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kinto/kinto/master/app.wsgi

uWSGI can be configured from the main ``.ini`` file. Just run it with::

    uwsgi --ini config/kinto.ini

uWSGI configuration can be tweaked in the ini file in the dedicated
``[uwsgi]`` section.

Here's an example, where ``app.wsgi`` is in the current folder, a ``.venv`` folder
contains the installed app and ``/var/uwsgi`` is writable for the ``kinto`` user:

.. code-block :: ini
    :emphasize-lines: 2-6

    [uwsgi]
    wsgi-file = app.wsgi
    virtualenv = .venv
    socket = /var/uwsgi/kinto.sock
    uid = kinto
    gid = kinto
    enable-threads = true
    chmod-socket = 666
    processes = 3
    master = true
    module = kinto
    harakiri = 120
    lazy = true
    lazy-apps = true
    single-interpreter = true
    buffer-size = 65535
    post-buffering = 65535
    plugin = python

To use a different ini file, the ``KINTO_INI`` environment variable
should be present with a path to it.

.. _production-cache-server:

Nginx as cache server
---------------------

If *Nginx* is used as a reverse proxy, it can also `act as a cache server <https://serversforhackers.com/nginx-caching>`_
by taking advantage of *Kinto* optional cache control response headers
(forced :ref:`in settings <configuration-client-caching>`
or set :ref:`on collections <collection-caching>`).

The sample *Nginx* configuration file shown above will look like so:

.. code-block:: none
    :emphasize-lines: 1,2,8

    proxy_cache_path /tmp/nginx levels=1:2 keys_zone=my_zone:100m inactive=200m;
    proxy_cache_key "$scheme$request_method$host$request_uri$";

    server {
        ...

        location / {
            proxy_cache my_zone;

            uwsgi_pass  kinto;
            include     /path/to/uwsgi_params; # the uwsgi_params file previously downloaded
        }
    }


Upgrading Kinto
===============

.. important::

    We follow `semver <http://semver.org/>`_ for version numbers.

    Before upgrading, read the release notes about potential breaking changes.

    See also ref:`API versioning <api-versioning>`.

First, make the potential changes to the configuration file, as described in
the release notes.

If installed as Python package, make sure the virtualenv is activated:

::

    source env/bin/activate

Now upgrade Kinto (and its dependencies) using the following command:

::

    pip install --upgrade kinto

Since there might be some database schema changes, do not forget to run the migration with:

::

    kinto migrate

Once done, restart the server. For example, with uwsgi:

::

    killall -HUP uwsgi


Using backoff
-------------

The :ref:`backoff feature <backoff-indicators>` of the HTTP API allows
to reduce the hits of clients during a period of time.

In order to leverage this, change the ``kinto.backoff`` setting to a number of
seconds (e.g. 3600) and reload/restart the server some time before starting
the upgrade process.

Do not forget to revert it once the upgrade is done ;)

        """ Add a :term:`route configuration` to the current
        configuration state, as well as possibly a :term:`view
        configuration` to be used to specify a :term:`view callable`
        that will be invoked when this route matches.  The arguments
        to this method are divided into *predicate*, *non-predicate*,
        and *view-related* types.  :term:`Route predicate` arguments
        narrow the circumstances in which a route will be match a
        request; non-predicate arguments are informational.

        Non-Predicate Arguments

        name

          The name of the route, e.g. ``myroute``.  This attribute is
          required.  It must be unique among all defined routes in a given
          application.

        factory

          A Python object (often a function or a class) or a :term:`dotted
          Python name` which refers to the same object that will generate a
          :app:`Pyramid` root resource object when this route matches. For
          example, ``mypackage.resources.MyFactory``.  If this argument is
          not specified, a default root factory will be used.  See
          :ref:`the_resource_tree` for more information about root factories.

        traverse

          If you would like to cause the :term:`context` to be
          something other than the :term:`root` object when this route
          matches, you can spell a traversal pattern as the
          ``traverse`` argument.  This traversal pattern will be used
          as the traversal path: traversal will begin at the root
          object implied by this route (either the global root, or the
          object returned by the ``factory`` associated with this
          route).

          The syntax of the ``traverse`` argument is the same as it is
          for ``pattern``. For example, if the ``pattern`` provided to
          ``add_route`` is ``articles/{article}/edit``, and the
          ``traverse`` argument provided to ``add_route`` is
          ``/{article}``, when a request comes in that causes the route
          to match in such a way that the ``article`` match value is
          ``'1'`` (when the request URI is ``/articles/1/edit``), the
          traversal path will be generated as ``/1``.  This means that
          the root object's ``__getitem__`` will be called with the
          name ``'1'`` during the traversal phase.  If the ``'1'`` object
          exists, it will become the :term:`context` of the request.
          :ref:`traversal_chapter` has more information about
          traversal.

          If the traversal path contains segment marker names which
          are not present in the ``pattern`` argument, a runtime error
          will occur.  The ``traverse`` pattern should not contain
          segment markers that do not exist in the ``pattern``
          argument.

          A similar combining of routing and traversal is available
          when a route is matched which contains a ``*traverse``
          remainder marker in its pattern (see
          :ref:`using_traverse_in_a_route_pattern`).  The ``traverse``
          argument to add_route allows you to associate route patterns
          with an arbitrary traversal path without using a
          ``*traverse`` remainder marker; instead you can use other
          match information.

          Note that the ``traverse`` argument to ``add_route`` is
          ignored when attached to a route that has a ``*traverse``
          remainder marker in its pattern.

        pregenerator

           This option should be a callable object that implements the
           :class:`pyramid.interfaces.IRoutePregenerator` interface.  A
           :term:`pregenerator` is a callable called by the
           :meth:`pyramid.request.Request.route_url` function to augment or
           replace the arguments it is passed when generating a URL for the
           route.  This is a feature not often used directly by applications,
           it is meant to be hooked by frameworks that use :app:`Pyramid` as
           a base.

        use_global_views

          When a request matches this route, and view lookup cannot
          find a view which has a ``route_name`` predicate argument
          that matches the route, try to fall back to using a view
          that otherwise matches the context, request, and view name
          (but which does not match the route_name predicate).

        static

          If ``static`` is ``True``, this route will never match an incoming
          request; it will only be useful for URL generation.  By default,
          ``static`` is ``False``.  See :ref:`static_route_narr`.

          .. versionadded:: 1.1

        accept

          This value represents a match query for one or more mimetypes in the
          ``Accept`` HTTP request header.  If this value is specified, it must
          be in one of the following forms: a mimetype match token in the form
          ``text/plain``, a wildcard mimetype match token in the form
          ``text/*`` or a match-all wildcard mimetype match token in the form
          ``*/*``.  If any of the forms matches the ``Accept`` header of the
          request, or if the ``Accept`` header isn't set at all in the request,
          this will match the current route. If this does not match the
          ``Accept`` header of the request, route matching continues.

        Predicate Arguments

        pattern

          The pattern of the route e.g. ``ideas/{idea}``.  This
          argument is required.  See :ref:`route_pattern_syntax`
          for information about the syntax of route patterns.  If the
          pattern doesn't match the current URL, route matching
          continues.

          .. note::

             For backwards compatibility purposes (as of :app:`Pyramid` 1.0), a
             ``path`` keyword argument passed to this function will be used to
             represent the pattern value if the ``pattern`` argument is
             ``None``.  If both ``path`` and ``pattern`` are passed, ``pattern``
             wins.

        xhr

          This value should be either ``True`` or ``False``.  If this
          value is specified and is ``True``, the :term:`request` must
          possess an ``HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH`` (aka
          ``X-Requested-With``) header for this route to match.  This
          is useful for detecting AJAX requests issued from jQuery,
          Prototype and other Javascript libraries.  If this predicate
          returns ``False``, route matching continues.

        request_method

          A string representing an HTTP method name, e.g. ``GET``, ``POST``,
          ``HEAD``, ``DELETE``, ``PUT`` or a tuple of elements containing
          HTTP method names.  If this argument is not specified, this route
          will match if the request has *any* request method.  If this
          predicate returns ``False``, route matching continues.

          .. versionchanged:: 1.2
             The ability to pass a tuple of items as ``request_method``.
             Previous versions allowed only a string.

        path_info

          This value represents a regular expression pattern that will
          be tested against the ``PATH_INFO`` WSGI environment
          variable.  If the regex matches, this predicate will return
          ``True``.  If this predicate returns ``False``, route
          matching continues.

        request_param

          This value can be any string.  A view declaration with this
          argument ensures that the associated route will only match
          when the request has a key in the ``request.params``
          dictionary (an HTTP ``GET`` or ``POST`` variable) that has a
          name which matches the supplied value.  If the value
          supplied as the argument has a ``=`` sign in it,
          e.g. ``request_param="foo=123"``, then the key
          (``foo``) must both exist in the ``request.params`` dictionary, and
          the value must match the right hand side of the expression (``123``)
          for the route to "match" the current request.  If this predicate
          returns ``False``, route matching continues.

        header

          This argument represents an HTTP header name or a header
          name/value pair.  If the argument contains a ``:`` (colon),
          it will be considered a name/value pair
          (e.g. ``User-Agent:Mozilla/.*`` or ``Host:localhost``).  If
          the value contains a colon, the value portion should be a
          regular expression.  If the value does not contain a colon,
          the entire value will be considered to be the header name
          (e.g. ``If-Modified-Since``).  If the value evaluates to a
          header name only without a value, the header specified by
          the name must be present in the request for this predicate
          to be true.  If the value evaluates to a header name/value
          pair, the header specified by the name must be present in
          the request *and* the regular expression specified as the
          value must match the header value.  Whether or not the value
          represents a header name or a header name/value pair, the
          case of the header name is not significant.  If this
          predicate returns ``False``, route matching continues.

        effective_principals

          If specified, this value should be a :term:`principal` identifier or
          a sequence of principal identifiers.  If the
          :attr:`pyramid.request.Request.effective_principals` property
          indicates that every principal named in the argument list is present
          in the current request, this predicate will return True; otherwise it
          will return False.  For example:
          ``effective_principals=pyramid.security.Authenticated`` or
          ``effective_principals=('fred', 'group:admins')``.

          .. versionadded:: 1.4a4

        custom_predicates

          .. deprecated:: 1.5
              This value should be a sequence of references to custom
              predicate callables.  Use custom predicates when no set of
              predefined predicates does what you need.  Custom predicates
              can be combined with predefined predicates as necessary.
              Each custom predicate callable should accept two arguments:
              ``info`` and ``request`` and should return either ``True``
              or ``False`` after doing arbitrary evaluation of the info
              and/or the request.  If all custom and non-custom predicate
              callables return ``True`` the associated route will be
              considered viable for a given request.  If any predicate
              callable returns ``False``, route matching continues.  Note
              that the value ``info`` passed to a custom route predicate
              is a dictionary containing matching information; see
              :ref:`custom_route_predicates` for more information about
              ``info``.

        predicates

          Pass a key/value pair here to use a third-party predicate
          registered via
          :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.add_route_predicate`.  More than
          one key/value pair can be used at the same time.  See
          :ref:`view_and_route_predicates` for more information about
          third-party predicates.

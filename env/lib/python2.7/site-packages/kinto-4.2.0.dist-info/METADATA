3.3.1 (2016-07-19)
------------------

**Protocol**

- Add the ``permissions_endpoint`` capability when the ``kinto.experimental_permissions_endpoint`` is set. (#722)


3.3.0 (2016-07-18)
------------------

**Protocol**

- Add new *experimental* endpoint ``GET /v1/permissions`` to retrieve the list of permissions
  granted on every kind of object (#600).
  Requires setting ``kinto.experimental_permissions_endpoint`` to be set to ``true``.

Protocol is now at version **1.8**. See `API changelog`_.

**Bug fixes**

------------------

**Protocol**

- Allow record IDs to be any string instead of just UUIDs (fixes #655).

Protocol is now at version **1.7**. See `API changelog`_.

**New features**

- ``kinto start`` now accepts a ``--port`` option to specify which port to listen to.
  **Important**: Because of a limitation in `Pyramid tooling <http://stackoverflow.com/a/21228232/147077>`_,
  it won't work if the port is hard-coded in your existing ``.ini`` file. Replace
  it by ``%(http_port)s`` or regenerate a new configuration file with ``kinto init``.
- Add support for ``pool_timeout`` option in Redis backend (fixes #620)
- Add new setting ``kinto.heartbeat_timeout_seconds`` to control the maximum duration
  of the heartbeat endpoint (fixes #601)
- Ability to define ID generators per object type via the settings

**Bug fixes**

- Fix loss of data attributes when permissions are replaced with ``PUT`` (fixes #601)
- Fix 400 response when posting data with ``id: "default"`` in default bucket.
- Fix 500 on heartbeat endpoint when a check does not follow the specs and raises instead of
  returning false.

**Internal changes**

- Renamed some permission backend methods for consistency with other classes (fixes #608)
- Removed some deprecated code that had been in ``kinto.core`` for too long.

**Documentation**

- Mention in groups documentation that the principal of a group to be used in a permissions
  definition is the full URI (e.g. ``"write": ["/buckets/blog/groups/authors"]``)

3.1.0 (2016-05-24)
------------------

**Protocol**

- Added the ``GET /contribute.json`` endpoint for open-source information (fixes #607)

Protocol is now at version **1.6**. See `API changelog`_.


**Bug fixes**

- Fix internal storage filtering when an empty list of values is provided.
- Authenticated users are now allowed to obtain an empty list of buckets on
  ``GET /buckets`` even if no bucket is readable (#454)
- Fix enabling flush enpoint with ``KINTO_FLUSH_ENDPOINT_ENABLED`` environment variable (fixes #588)
- Fix reading settings for events listeners from environment variables (fixes #515)

- Fix bug that prevented startup if old Cliquet configuration values
  were still around (#633)

**Documentation**

3.0.1 (2016-05-20)
------------------

**Bug fixes**

- Fix crash when a cache expires setting is set for a specific bucket or collection. (#597)
- Mark old cliquet backend settings as deprecated (but continue to support them). (#596)


3.0.0 (2016-05-18)
------------------

- Major version update. Merged cliquet into kinto.core. This is
  intended to simplify the experience of people who are new to Kinto.
  Addresses #687.
- Removed ``initialize_cliquet()``, which has been deprecated for a while.
- Removed ``cliquet_protocol_version``. Kinto already defines
  incompatible API variations as part of its URL format (e.g. ``/v0``,
  ``/v1``). Services based on kinto.core are free to use
  ``http_api_version`` to indicate any additional changes to their
  APIs.
- Simplify settings code. Previously, ``public_settings`` could be
  prefixed with a project name, which would be reflected in the output
  of the ``hello`` view. However, this was never part of the API
  specification, and was meant to be solely a backwards-compatibility
  hack for first-generation Kinto clients. Kinto public settings
  should always be exposed unprefixed. Applications developed against
  kinto.core can continue using these names even after they transition
  clients to the new implementation of their service.

**Bug fixes**

- Add an explicit message when the server is configured as read-only and the
  collection timestamp fails to be saved (ref Kinto/kinto#558)
- Prevent the browser to cache server responses between two sessions. (#593)
- Redirects version prefix to hello page when trailing_slash_redirect is enabled. (#700)
- Fix crash when setting empty permission list with PostgreSQL permission backend (fixes Kinto/kinto#575)
- Fix crash when type of values in querystring for exclude/include is wrong (fixes Kinto/kinto#587)
- Fix crash when providing duplicated principals in permissions with PostgreSQL permission backend (fixes #702)
- Add ``app.wsgi`` to the manifest file. This helps address #543.


2.1.1 (2016-04-29)
------------------

**Bug fixes**

- Fix crash in JSON schema validation when additional properties are provided (fixes #548)
- Strip internal fields before validating JSON schema (fixes #549)
- Fix migration of triggers in PostgreSQL storage backend when upgrading from Kinto<2.0.
  Run the ``migrate`` command will basically re-create them (fixes #559)

**Documentation**

- Link to english version of kinto presentation article (#553, thanks @glasserc!)
- Document basics about PostgreSQL privileges (#547)
- Change links from readthedocs.org to readthedocs.io (#557)

Protocol is now in version **1.5**. See `API changelog`_.


2.0.0 (2016-03-08)
------------------

**Protocol**

- Allow buckets to store arbitrary properties. (#239, #462)
- Delete every (writable) buckets using ``DELETE /v1/buckets``
- Delete every (writable) collections using ``DELETE /v1/buckets/<bucket-id>/collections``
- Clients are redirected to URLs without trailing slash only if the current URL
  does not exist (#656)
- Partial responses can now be specified for nested objects (#445)
  For example, ``/records?_fields=address.street``.
- List responses are now sorted by last_modified descending by default (#434,
  thanks @ayusharma)
- Server now returns 415 error response if client cannot accept JSON response (#461, mozilla-services/cliquet#667)
- Server now returns 415 error response if client does not send JSON request (#461, mozilla-services/cliquet#667)
- Add the ``__lbheartbeat__`` endpoint, for load balancer membership test.
- Add the ``flush_endpoint``, ``schema`` and ``default_bucket`` to the capabilities
  if enabled in settings (#270)

Protocol is now in version **1.4**. See `API changelog`_.

**Breaking changes**

- ``kinto.plugins.default_bucket`` plugin is no longer assumed. We invite users
  to check that the ``kinto.plugins.default_bucket`` is present in the
  ``includes`` setting if they expect it. (ref #495)
- ``kinto start`` must be explicitly run with ``--reload`` in order to
  restart the server when code or configuration changes (ref #490).
- Errors are not swallowed anymore during the execution of ``ResourceChanged``
  events subscribers.

  Subscribers are still executed within the transaction like before.

  Subscribers are still executed even if the transaction is eventually rolledback.
  Every subscriber execution succeeds, or none.

  Thus, subscribers of these events should only perform operations that are reversed
  on transaction rollback: most likely database storage operations.

  For irreversible operations see the new ``AfterResourceChanged`` event.

**New features**

- Event subscribers are now ran synchronously and can thus alter responses (#421)
- Resource events are now merged in batch requests. One event per resource and
  per action is emitted when a transaction is committed (mozilla-services/cliquet#634)
- Monitor time of events listeners execution (mozilla-services/cliquet#503)
- Added a new ``AfterResourceChanged`` event, that is sent only when the commit
  in database is done and successful.
  `See more details <https://cliquet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/notifications.html>`_.
- Track execution time on StatsD for each authentication sub-policy (mozilla-services/cliquet#639)
- Default console log renderer now has colours (mozilla-service/cliquet#671)
- Output Kinto version with ``kinto --version`` (thanks @ayusharma)

**Bug fixes**

- Fix PostgreSQL backend timestamps when collection is empty (#433)
- ``ResourceChanged`` events are not emitted if a batch subrequest fails (mozilla-services/cliquet#634)
  There are still emitted if the whole batch transaction is eventually rolledback.
- Fix a migration of PostgreSQL schema introduced that was never executed (mozilla-services/cliquet#604)
- Fix statsd initialization on storage (mozilla-services/cliquet#637)
- Providing bad last modified values on delete now returns 400 (mozilla-services/cliquet#665)
- Providing last modified in the past for delete now follows behaviour create/update (mozilla-services/cliquet#665)
- Do not always return 412 errors when request header ``If-None-Match: *``
  is sent on ``POST /collection`` (fixes #489, mozilla-service/cliquet#673)
- Fix secret in ini on Python 3 (fixes #341)
- Error when trying to create an empty directory (fixes #475)

- Renamed ``hello`` to ``project_name``
- Renamed ``protocol_version`` to ``cliquet_protocol_version``
- Renamed ``documentation`` to ``project_docs``
- Renamed ``version`` to ``project_version``


**New features**

- New options in configuration of listeners to specify filtered actions and
  resource names (mozilla-services/cliquet#492, mozilla-services/cliquet#555)
- Add ability to be notified on read actions on a resource (disabled by
  default) (mozilla-services/cliquet#493)

**Internal changes**

- Clarified how Kinto is versionned in the documentation (#305)

1.9.0 (2015-11-18)
------------------

- Upgraded to *Cliquet* 2.11.0

**Breaking changes**

- For PostgreSQL backends, it is recommended to specify ``postgresql://``.

**Protocol**

- In the hello view:

   - Add a ``bucket`` attribute in ``user`` mapping allowing clients
     to obtain the actual id of their default bucket
   - Add the ``protocol_version`` to tell which protocol version is
     implemented by the service. (#324)

- ``_since`` and ``_before`` now accepts an integer value between quotes ``"``,
  as it would be returned in the ``ETag`` response header.
- A batch request now fails if one of the subrequests fails
  (mozilla-services/cliquet#510) (*see new feature about
  transactions*)

**New features**

- Add a Kinto command for start and migrate operation. (#129)
- Add a Kinto command to create a configuration file. (#278)
- A transaction now covers the whole request/response cycle (#194).
  If an error occurs during the request processing, every operation performed
  is rolled back. **Note:** This is only enabled with *PostgreSQL* backends. In
  other words, the rollback has no effect on backends like *Redis* or *Memory*.

- New settings for backends when using PostgreSQL: ``*_max_backlog``,
  ``*_max_overflow``, ``*_pool_recycle``, ``*_pool_timeout`` to
  control connections pool behaviour.

**Bug fixes**

- Fix 500 error response (instead of 503) when storage backend fails during
  implicit creation of objects on ``default`` bucket. (fixes #236)
- Fixed ``Dockerfile`` for PostgreSQL backends.
- Fix JSON schema crash when no field information is available.

**Internal changes**

- Optimization for retrieval of user principals (#263)
- Do not build the Docker container when using Docker Compose.
- Add Python 3.5 on TravisCI
- Add schema validation loadtest (fixes #201)
- Multiple documentation improvements.
- The PostgreSQL backends now use SQLAlchemy sessions.

- Add a ``readonly`` setting to run the service in read-only mode. (#241)

How to contribute
=================

Thanks for your interest in contributing to *Kinto*!

We love community feedback and are glad to review contributions of any size - from typos in the documentation to critical bug fixes - so don’t be shy!

Report bugs
-----------

Report bugs at <https://github.com/Kinto/kinto/issues/new>

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

-   Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
-   Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

Fix bugs
--------

Check out the [open bugs] - anything tagged with the **easy-pick** label\_ could be a good choice for newcomers.

Implement features
------------------

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with **enhancement**\_ is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Write documentation
-------------------

*Kinto* could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official docs, in docstrings, or even on the Web in blog posts, articles, and such.

This official documentation is maintained in [Github]. The `docs` folder contains the documentation sources in [reStructuredText] format. And you can generate the docs locally with:

    make docs

Output is written at `docs/_build/html/index.html`.

We obviously accept pull requests for this documentation, just as we accept them for bug fixes and features! See open issues &lt;Kinto/kinto/labels/documentation&gt;.

Submit feedback
---------------

Any issue with the **question** label\_ is open for feedback, so feel free to share your thoughts with us!

The best way to send feedback is to [file a new issue] on GitHub.

If you are proposing a feature:

-   Explain how you envision it working. Try to be as detailed as you can.
-   Try to keep the scope as narrow as possible. This will help make it easier to implement.
-   Feel free to include any code you might already have, even if it’s just a rough idea. This is a volunteer-driven project, and contributions are welcome :)

Contribute.json
---------------
